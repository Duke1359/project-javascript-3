Created a simple interactive webpage that displays a to-do list using JavaScript.

Used an array to store the list items.
Used DOM manipulation to display the items on the webpage.
Added functionality for the user to add new items to the list using an input field and a button.
Implemented an event listener that updates the list when the user submits a new item.
